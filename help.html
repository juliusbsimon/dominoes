Dominoes GT Style is a domino game which is based on the game played in Guyana. 
The Rules are simple, just play something that matches!!!. To aid you in playing this game certain dominoes are highlighted; doubles or 'rests' as they are      called in GT are displayed in yellow, while dominoes which are playable are     displayed in green.

A domino is played by first selecting the corresponding number which is         displayed to the left of each domino. After selecting the domino you wish to    play you   then decide whether you want to place the domino to the right or to the left of the dominoes currently on the table. Please Note the the largest double is automatically played even if it is in your hand. The first person to play all their dominoes wins the game. If you do not have any playable dominoes you "RAP" or skip your turn. If all the players are unable to play any dominoes then the winner is decided based on the total value of the dominoes which remain in the players' hands.
